        <h1>Tula's Favorite Movies Of All Time</h1>
        <hr>

        <h3>Avenger's Endgame</h3>
        <p>I love all the Avenger movies, but this one did it for me. The dramatics, the power scaling, all of it. Cinema.</p>

        <h3>Chronicles</h3>
        <p>I found this movie one day in my step-dad's maze of dvd's. This movie is where I found out I have a love for confused young adults and superpowers</p>

        <h3>Iron Man</h3>
